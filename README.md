# Darkblood Plus for [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)

Improved version of the built in [Darkblood](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes#darkblood) theme with [PoshGit](http://dahlbyk.github.io/posh-git/) support. The built in version works with fixed colors instead of the shell defined colors, like in previous versions of the theme. This brings back that old method of coloring, allowing for easy color customization via the shell.
