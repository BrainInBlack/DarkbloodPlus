# Darkblood Plus for [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)

Improved version of the built in [Darkblood](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes#darkblood) theme. The built in version works with fixed colors instead of the terminal defined colors, like in previous versions of the theme. This brings back that old method of coloring, allowing for easy color customization via the terminal.

There are some further tweaks applied, but the overall spirit of the original is still intact. The tweaks where made with the [MaterialDarker](https://github.com/julianlatest/material-windows-terminal) color scheme and [FiraMono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) in mind.
